## Hi there üëã. I'm a software engineer who came from a career in musicüé∑. I love to build build build build build üèóÔ∏è. 
<!-- #### Presently working on an AI-powered E-Commerce application with my buddy Joao Matos, composed in Blazor, deployed via Docker Container here: http://intellishop.haxbyte.com. -->

Introduction to My Software Engineering Journey - Watch Video

#### .NET developer, full stack with Angular and Azure. Strongest in Blazor. 3x AWS certified (SAA/Dev), 2x Azure certified (Az-204 and Az-900). I know Figma, basic DevOps (Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins), as well as Javascript/React/MERN stack. I presently have more than 300 repos in Github: https://github.com/shalant. The strongest part of my portfolio is the sheer amount of applications that I have built! Currently composing an AI-powered E-Commerce application called Intellicart, using Blazor and cheaply hosted via Docker and Digital Ocean. Please ask me about it :)

#### Before my career in Software Development, I was a musician for 25 years. I played some major venues like Chicago's Millennium Park, Princeton University, as well as touring Europe and playing NYC 30x. Check out my album "Better Than TV" wherever music can be purchased. I continue playing professionally :)
<!-- #### My most recent position was at an AI company ü§ñ creating frontends for Dotnet applications (Blazor, MVC). I worked with the team to refactor a customer portal, create an admin portal from scratch, produce a functional application for a fortune 100 company, and an AI-powered chatbot. The last project was for a top national law firm that requested a custom application to help sort through a litigants in a class-action lawsuit. Our application made it possible to enter a chat prompt into a tablet, and discover whether or not the person met the requirements. Additionally, the app supplied the documents that supported the conclusion.
#### I have also worked for a medium-sized manufacturing firm and a B2B marketing company. As of January, 2025, I am looking for a new role. -->
